## Boost retention with engagement
We know many IECPs are struggling with losing sales in their optical business to online competitors, like Warby Parker, and big retailers like Costco and LensCrafters.

We created an app called Pleye. Pleye helps eye care professionals have their own app to boost customer engagement and increase return visits.

## Transforms into your app
[Apply](https://www.blueprint-lab.com/qrcode) for a QR code that patients scan to change Pleye into your practice's custom app featuring your logo and colors.

## Future features
In the future, we will offer new modules such as virtual try on, easy appointment scheduling, and push notifications. Your patients can try new frames and sunglasses at home, then schedule an appointment to buy and fit them at your office. We'll send them notifications about upcoming appointments, events, and more.
