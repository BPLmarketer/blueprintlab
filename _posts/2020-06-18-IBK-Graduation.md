The IBK Changgong Accelerator program partners with [N15 Partners](http://n15partners.asia/) to support startups by providing mentoring from experts as well as free offices. As IBK is a bank, support for loans, investment relations, and business networking are given. Legal services such as patent and tax services are also provided. With the goal of incubating 500 startup companies by 2022, IBK will continue to open additional support centers.
